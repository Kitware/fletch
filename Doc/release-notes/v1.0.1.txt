Fletch v1.0.1 Release Notes
===========================

This is a patch release of Fletch that provides bug fixes and documentation
improvements over the previous v1.0.0 release.


Updates since v1.0.0
--------------------

Documentation

 * Updated the Fletch README with known issues

Project Configuration

 * Updated VTK to build with the VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS option turned off


Fixes since v1.0.0
------------------

CMake

 * Fixed support for CMake 2.8.12 by removing unsupported character escape
   sequences and replacing a .tar.xz download with a .tar.gz.

OpenCV 3.1

 * Patched OpenCV 3.1 to remove the improper use of INSTALL_NAME_DIR which
   causes packaging issues on MacOS.  This same patch was applied to OpenCV 2.4
   in Fletch and was accepted upstream in OpenCV 3.2.  Details here:
   https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/6006

 * Patched OpenCV 3.1 to fix Debug builds on Windows when Python is enabled.
   The issue was failure to link to python27_d.lib, which is not distributed
   with Python installers.

 * Patched OpenCV 3.1 to work with MSCV 1911 and darknet.
   The issue was that OpenCV was not installed to the directory expected by darknet
   because the MSVC version was not recognized in a recent version of
   VisualStudio 2017.

PNG

 * Prevented excessive symlinking of libraries. The process was causing issues for the Ninja generator. It is a redundant operation since the soversion property will suffice.

Qt

 * Fixed an issue with building Qt with the latest patched update to Visual
   Studio 2017 due to an improper CMake check on the version of Visual Studio.
