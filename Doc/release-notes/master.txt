 * Add an optional Qt update to version 5.12.8
 * Update PostGIS from 2.4.3 to 2.5.3
 * Update libtiff from 4.0.6 to 4.1.0

Fixes since v1.4.0
------------------

 * Provide Raster capability to PostGIS by adding GDAL to its build.
 * Change the default flag that provides Qt to the OpenCV build to False.
 * Patch the ZLib CMakeLists.txt to elimate the 'd' suffix on the library name on WIN32.
 * Disable the 'examples' build for Darknet. It was causing a build failure on WIN32.
 * When building Boost in Fletch, always ignore the systemsite-config. That is the config from an installed version and will conflict with our build.
 * Force PDAL to ignore libjson. It can't use the Fletch package nor can it use similar system packages.
 * Set cmake_policy CMP0074 to NEW.
