Fletch v1.5.0 Release Notes
===========================

This is a minor release of Fletch that provides both new functionality and fixes over
the previous v1.4.0 release.

There are many other changes in this release. These are detailed in the change log below.

Updates since v1.4.0
--------------------

 * Updated Ceres Solver from v1.13 to v1.14.
 * Add an optional Qt update to version 5.12.8
 * Update PostGIS from 2.4.3 to 2.5.3
 * Update libtiff from 4.0.6 to 4.1.0
 * Update ZLib from 1.2.9 to 1.2.11
 * Update Eigen from 3.3.4 to 3.3.7
 * Remove support for OpenCV 2
 * Add VTK version 9.0.1
 * Update PyBind11 from 2.2.1 to 2.5.0

Fixes since v1.4.0
------------------

 * Provide Raster capability to PostGIS by adding GDAL to its build.
 * Change the default flag that provides Qt to the OpenCV build to False.
 * Patch the ZLib CMakeLists.txt to elimate the 'd' suffix on the library name on WIN32.
 * Disable the 'examples' build for Darknet. It was causing a build failure on WIN32.
 * When building Boost in Fletch, always ignore the systemsite-config. That is the config from an installed version and will conflict with our build.
 * Force PDAL to ignore libjson. It can't use the Fletch package nor can it use similar system packages.
 * Set cmake_policy CMP0074 to NEW.
