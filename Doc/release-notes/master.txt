Fixes since v1.2.0
------------------

- Libjpeg-turbo and libtiff are now requirements to build libgeotiff. It was possible to
  try to build libgeotiff without libjpeg-tubo and libtiff enabled, this would result in
  several build errors.

- GDAL will now no longer built with google libkml support. GDAL would fail occasionally
  as a result of automatically finding and using an old libkml version.
